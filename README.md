Texting-Stats is an android app that parses and organizes the SMS database by how many texts each person sent to each other. Right now it is possible to see the total amount of texts sent/received per contact, and also organize that by day. The main purpose for this app is to show the ratio of sent/received SMS for any specific contact.
